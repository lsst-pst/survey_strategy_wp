# Tools for Survey Strategy White Paper Writers

This folder contains some notebooks to help support people writing cadence white papers in fall 2018. 

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [BasicNvisitsAreaTrade](BasicNvisitsAreaTrade.ipynb) | This notebook demos how to evaluate the total number of fields in an area, split a typical number of available visits per field, divide those visits by filter per field, and then calculate the approximate coadded depth expected per filter per field. |
| [WFD+bigarea](WFD+bigarea.ipynb) | This notebook demonstrates a split between WFD + "the rest of the sky", where the rest of the sky is a big footprint extending to +32 degrees. This shows we could potentially have 254 visits/field over the "rest of the sky" after assigning 825 visits to WFD fields. |
| [ExposureTimesForConstantDepth](ExposureTimesForConstantDepth.ipynb) | Evaluate the typical range of single visit depth in WFD in a baseline style survey, then evaluate how many exposures would be required to really keep constant depth. Then evaluate expected range in single visit depth if exposure time varied between 20-60s per visit. Also evaluates mean/median/mode of typical WFD visits. |
