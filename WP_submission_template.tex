\section{White Paper Information}
Please provide contact information (name and email address) of the appropriate author(s) for this white paper.
In addition, please provide the following categorization for your white paper:
\begin{enumerate} 
\item {\bf Science Category:} which of the four main LSST science themes are addressed? Are there other
science programs addressed by this white paper?
\item {\bf Survey Type Category:} please choose one of the following possibilities: the main `wide-fast-deep'
   survey, mini survey, Deep Drilling field, Target of Opportunity observation, Other (provide details). 
\item {\bf Observing Strategy Category:} please choose one of the following possibilities: 
    \begin{itemize} 
     \item a specific observing strategy to enable specific time domain science, 
	that is relatively agnostic to where the telescope is pointed (e.g., a science case enabled 
	by relatively deep precise time-resolved multi-color photometry). 
     \item a specific pointing or set of pointings that is (relatively) agnostic of the detailed observing 
	strategy or cadence, (e.g., a science case enabled by very deep precise multi-color 
	photometry)
      \item an integrated program with science that hinges on the combination of pointing and detailed 
	observing strategy (e.g., search for variable stars in the 
	LMC/SMC). 
       \item other category (please describe).
    \end{itemize}  
\end{enumerate}

\section{Scientific Motivation}

\begin{footnotesize}
{\it Describe the scientific justification for this white paper in the context
of your field, as well as the importance to the general program of astronomy, 
including the relevance over the next decade. 
Describe other relevant data, and justify why LSST is the best facility for these observations.
(Limit: 2 pages + 1 page for figures.)}

\section{Technical Description}
\begin{footnotesize}
{\it Describe your survey strategy modifications or proposed observations. Please comment on each observing constraint
below, including the technical motivation behind any constraints. Where relevant, indicate
if the constraint applies to all requested observations or a specific subset. Please note which 
constraints are not relevant or important for your science goals.}
\end{footnotesize}

\subsection{High-level description}
\begin{footnotesize}
{\it Describe or illustrate your ideal sequence of observations.}
\end{footnotesize}

\vspace{.3in}

\subsection{Footprint -- pointings, regions and/or constraints}
\begin{footnotesize}{\it Describe the specific pointings or general region (RA/Dec, Galactic longitude/latitude or 
Ecliptic longitude/latitude) for the observations. Please describe any additional requirements, especially if there
are no specific constraints on the pointings (e.g. stellar density, galactic dust extinction).}
\end{footnotesize}

\subsection{Image quality}
\begin{footnotesize}{\it Constraints on the image quality (seeing).}\end{footnotesize}

\subsection{Individual image depth and/or sky brightness}
\begin{footnotesize}{\it Constraints on the sky brightness in each image and/or individual image depth for point sources.
Please differentiate between motivation for a desired sky brightness or individual image depth (as 
calculated for point sources). Please provide sky brightness or image depth constraints per filter.}
\end{footnotesize}

\subsection{Co-added image depth and/or total number of visits}
\begin{footnotesize}{\it  Constraints on the total co-added depth and/or total number of visits.
Please differentiate between motivations for a given co-added depth and total number of visits. 
Please provide desired co-added depth and/or total number of visits per filter, if relevant.}
\end{footnotesize}

\subsection{Number of visits within a night}
\begin{footnotesize}{\it Constraints on the number of exposures (or visits) in a night, especially if considering sequences of visits.  }
\end{footnotesize}

\subsection{Distribution of visits over time}
\begin{footnotesize}{\it Constraints on the timing of visits --- within a night, between nights, between seasons or
between years (which could be relevant for rolling cadence choices in the WideFastDeep. 
Please describe optimum visit timing as well as acceptable limits on visit timing, and options in
case of missed visits (due to weather, etc.). If this timing should include particular sequences
of filters, please describe.}
\end{footnotesize}

\subsection{Filter choice}
\begin{footnotesize}
{\it Please describe any filter constraints not included above.}
\end{footnotesize}

\subsection{Exposure constraints}
\begin{footnotesize}
{\it Describe any constraints on the minimum or maximum exposure time per visit required (or alternatively, saturation limits).
Please comment on any constraints on the number of exposures in a visit.}
\end{footnotesize}

\subsection{Other constraints}
\begin{footnotesize}
{\it Any other constraints.}
\end{footnotesize}

\subsection{Estimated time requirement}
\begin{footnotesize}
{\it Approximate total time requested for these observations, using the guidelines available at \url{https://github.com/lsst-pst/survey_strategy_wp}.}

    \caption{{\bf Constraint Rankings:} Summary of the relative importance of various survey strategy constraints. Please rank the importance of each of these considerations, from 1=very important, 2=somewhat important, 3=not important. If a given constraint depends on other parameters in the table, but these other parameters are not important in themselves, please only mark the final constraint as important. For example, individual image depth depends on image quality, sky brightness, and number of exposures in a visit; if your science depends on the individual image depth but not directly on the other parameters, individual image depth would be `1' and the other parameters could be marked as `3', giving us the most flexibility when determining the composition of a visit, for example.}

\subsection{Technical trades}
\begin{footnotesize}
{\it To aid in attempts to combine this proposed survey modification with others, please address the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the effect of a trade-off between your requested survey footprint (area) and requested co-added depth or number of visits?
    \item If not requesting a specific timing of visits, what is the effect of a trade-off between the uniformity of observations and the frequency of observations in time? e.g. a `rolling cadence' increases the frequency of visits during a short time period at the cost of fewer visits the rest of the time, making the overall sampling less uniform.
    \item What is the effect of a trade-off on the exposure time and number of visits (e.g. increasing the individual image depth but decreasing the overall number of visits)?
    \item What is the effect of a trade-off between uniformity in number of visits and co-added depth? Is there any benefit to real-time exposure time optimization to obtain nearly constant single-visit limiting depth?
    \item Are there any other potential trade-offs to consider when attempting to balance this proposal with others which may have similar but slightly different requests?
\end{enumerate}}
\end{footnotesize}

\section{Performance Evaluation}
\begin{footnotesize}
{\it Please describe how to evaluate the performance of a given survey in achieving your desired
science goals, ideally as a heuristic tied directly to the observing strategy (e.g. number of visits obtained
within a window of time with a specified set of filters) with a clear link to the resulting effect on science.
More complex metrics which more directly evaluate science output (e.g. number of eclipsing binaries successfully
identified as a result of a given survey) are also encouraged, preferably as a secondary metric.
If possible, provide threshold values for these metrics at which point your proposed science would be unsuccessful 
and where it reaches an ideal goal, or explain why this is not possible to quantify. While not necessary, 
if you have already transformed this into a MAF metric, please add a link to the code (or a PR to 
\href{https://github.com/lsst-nonproject/sims_maf_contrib}{sims\_maf\_contrib}) in addition to the text description. (Limit: 2 pages).}
